# Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to get summary statistics in the months of June and December. This is to help with projecting possible business based on months.
# Results
* The month of June sees very little difference in temperature throughout the month. The maximum temperature is only 21 degrees warmer than the minimum. ![June]https://github.com/peterthepage/surfs_up/blob/main/JuneSummary.PNG
* The month of December has a little more variance in temperature but not much more in terms of maximum and minimum. The difference is 27 degrees. ![Dec]https://github.com/peterthepage/surfs_up/blob/main/DecemberSummary.PNG
* The month of December also has a higher standard deviation in temperature. Overall though the average temperatures for the two months are very similar.
# Summary
The good news for the business is that it appears to be sustainable year round. With the temperatures being fairly similar throughout the year it should be able to be steady throughout the year. While there may be some days that don't work in the winter for surfing, most days will still work.
* To get a better idea of how often temperature will ruin the December days I'd want to know how often temperatures are below 65 degrees to be able to estimate slow days.
* I'd also like to cross reference business data a year in with temperature data to get a better idea of the perfect temperature where the business will thrive.
